This simulation is a basic model of a beehive controlling temperature, inspired by the book Complex Adaptive Systems by John H. Miller and Scott E. Page.

As the temperature rises during the day, bees will begin flapping to bring the temperature of the hive back down, once it exceeds a desired threshold.

This simulation demonstrates two specific features.  The first is the use of SwingBuilder to create UIs that reflect simulation information.  See the UI.groovy script for specifics.

The second is to demonstrate how entities having distributed trigger values, in this case desired_temp for bees, causes spikes to smooth out.  You can comment the random distribution of the desired_temp out in Beehive.groovy and run, then uncomment it and run and notice the big difference in behavior.
